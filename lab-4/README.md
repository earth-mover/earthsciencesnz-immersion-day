# Lab 4: Building a Slippy Map

**Goal**: Build an interactive web application

In this lab, you'll build a simple, interactive WMS slippy tile map in Mapbox that makes live queries to the new data product via Earthmover's Flux API, demonstrating a complete "data-to-decision" workflow from raw data to functional application.
