# Lab 0: Introduction to Xarray and Zarr

**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Presenter**: [Tom Nicholas](https://github.com/TomNicholas) (Earthmover)

## Overview

This introductory lab covers the fundamentals of working with Xarray and Zarr - the foundational technologies that power the Earthmover platform. These tools are essential for working with large, multidimensional geoscientific datasets in a cloud-native environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Understand what Xarray is and why it's perfect for climate/weather data
- Learn the core concepts: DataArrays, Datasets, dimensions, coordinates
- Perform basic data operations, indexing, and slicing
- Create simple visualizations of geospatial data
- Understand Zarr as a cloud-native storage format
- Experience how these tools enable fast, scalable analysis of large datasets

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Xarray DataArrays and Datasets**: Working with labeled, multidimensional arrays
- **Dimensions and Coordinates**: Understanding time, latitude, longitude dimensions
- **Indexing and Selection**: Selecting data by coordinate values and labels
- **Basic Computations**: Simple statistical operations on climate data
- **Visualization**: Creating maps and time series plots
- **Zarr Storage**: Cloud-optimized chunked arrays for fast data access

## What You'll Do

1. Load and explore a sample weather dataset using Xarray
2. Practice indexing and selecting data for specific regions and time periods
3. Perform basic calculations (means, anomalies, trends)
4. Create visualizations including maps and time series
5. Understand how Zarr enables efficient cloud access to large datasets

This foundation will prepare you for the catalog exploration and advanced analysis in the subsequent labs.
