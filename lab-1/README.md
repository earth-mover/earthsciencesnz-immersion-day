# Lab 1: Exploring the Catalog

**Goal**: Discover what's available

In this lab, you'll log into a pre-configured AWS SageMaker Studio environment and explore the pre-loaded data catalog (ERA5, DEM, etc.) in a Jupyter Notebook. You'll run basic Xarray queries that are accelerated by Icechunk, experiencing the platform's speed firsthand.
