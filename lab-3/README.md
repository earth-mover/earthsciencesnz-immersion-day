# Lab 3: Creating a New Data Product

**Goal**: Create something new by fusing data across domains

This lab guides you through a more advanced workflow that combines multiple datasets (e.g., elevation data from the DEM and rainfall data from ERA5). You'll create a new, derived dataset—for example, a "Landslide Susceptibility Index"—and write it back into the Earthmover platform, making it a new, reusable asset.
